This is my app for DELTA Inductions Task 1.

It is a trainer app for "Death's Daughter"

The Main acitivity is to be used by "Death" to set a number for his daughter to guess.
"Death" can also access the Admin Panel to reset the scores or set the max number of trails his daughter can make.

The "Daughter" makes guesses and depending on how far or near the guess is, the background changes from red to green respectively.
If she fails to make the right guess after the set max Number of trails (by default - 7), then the game is scored as her loss.
If she manages to guess right within the allowed guesses then the game is scored as a win.

Landscape mode is available for all activites :)
Main activity's color changes based on relationship between no of wins and no of losses.

Happy killing ;)
